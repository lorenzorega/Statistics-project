# Statistics-project
Here is a group project done for my Statistic course at Columbia University.  

We selected five futures contracts tracking the price of different commodities during a recession; specifically the dot-com bubble.   
We hope to gain insight into the correlation of different commodities during times of recession, with our  
main hypothesis that people reallocate their investment into commodities or cash during times of uncertainty and poor economic conditions.  



Given one stock symbol, the notebook can:    
(1) Display histograms for the data (i.e., log-returns) by stock symbol.   
(2) Display a normal probability plot to see if the data is approximately normal.   
(3) Create (approximate) confidence intervals for the means and variances given a confidence level.   
(4) Perform a regression of the log-return on time (i.e., time on the horizontal axis and log-return on the vertical axis).  
Given two stock symbols, the notebook can:   
(1) Test the equality of the two population means.   
(2) Perform a regression of one log-return on the other.
