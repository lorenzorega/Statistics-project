# Statistics-project
Here is a project done for my Statistic course at Columbia University.  


Given one stock symbol, the notebook can:    
(1) Display histograms for the data (i.e., log-returns) by stock symbol.   
(2) Display a normal probability plot to see if the data is approximately normal.   
(3) Create (approximate) confidence intervals for the means and variances given a confidence level.   
(4) Perform a regression of the log-return on time (i.e., time on the horizontal axis and log-return on the vertical axis).  
Given two stock symbols, the notebook can:   
(1) Test the equality of the two population means.   
(2) Perform a regression of one log-return on the other.
